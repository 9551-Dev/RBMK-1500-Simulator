Welcome to RBMK-1500 Simulator

The goal of this project is to create a 1 to 1 realistic simulation of a generic RBMK-1500 unit and all its elements.

What has been achieved so far:

- Thermodynamic model of the main coolant circuit and steam supply;
- Simplified simulation of turbines and condensers;
- Simulation of the feedwater circuits;
- Simplified Reactor Core Model including Automatic Rod Control;
- Selsyn indicators;
- MTK indicator;
- Simplified Xenon and decay heat simulation:

Roadmap (more things will be added to this over time):

- Better Control and Safety Systems;
- ECCS simulation;
- Digital MTK with more functionality 
- Rework of TG and Condensers;
- Advanced Reactor Core Model;
- Electrical systems
- Auxiliary Systems;
- User-friendliness stuff like UI themes and settings for increasing simulation speed like burnup and decay; 
- Fission and decay product simulation for each element;
- Refuelling;

Installation:

-  Make sure your machine has the java runtime environment installed (https://www.java.com/)
-  Download the compiled .jar from the releases section
-  Alternatively download the source code and compile your own .jar


All of the code in this project is open-source and can be used and altered in any way possible without prior permission. 

"Science and industry, knowledge and application, discovery and practical realization leading to new discoveries, cunning of brain and of hand, toil of mind and muscle – all work together. Each discovery, each advance, each increase in the sum of human riches, owes its being to the physical and mental travail of the past and the present.
By what right then can any one whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say – This is mine, not yours?" - Petr Kropotkin.
